## About Me :computer: :basketball: :bike: 


I have an extensive professional background (8+ years) in Healthcare and IT. I have had the opportunity to gain experience in various facets of a business, but I enjoy being a part of Operations and IT. 

When I'm not at work or studying, you can catch me playing basketball or going on a long bike ride.

I love learning new things and provide a helping hand where I can. Feel free to reach out to me if you want to collaborate.
