## About Me :computer: :basketball: :bike: 


I am a Full Stack Developer who has an extensive professional background (8+ years) in Healthcare and IT. 

I have had the opportunity to gain experience and knowledge in various functions of a business, from Lab Operations to IT. 

When I'm not coding, you can catch me playing basketball or going on a long bike ride.

I love learning new things and provide a helping hand where I can. Feel free to reach out to me if you want to collaborate.
